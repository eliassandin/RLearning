Sn = loss
Sn-1 : a [1, 0, 0 ..., 0] hans tur
Sn-2 : a [0,0, -1, 0, ...] min tur


Net(Sn) = 1
Net(Sn-1) = -1
Net(Sn-2) = gamma*1
...

during training:

S = current state, a = moves = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Si = next states from making move i

1 :
pick best of S0 S1 and so on, we pick Si

get to lose state Sn
Net(Sn) = 1
and move backward
Net(Sn-1) = -1

back to first state after making first move,
only Net(Sj) is updated
